# Halo ðŸ˜‡
****
Halo was [Hack Club](www.hackclub.com)'s 6th [Day of Service](https://days-of-service.hackclub.dev/), an initiative started to bridge the gender gap in technology. We organized a day of coding in partnership with a local youth organization, [The Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles](https://www.girlscoutsla.org/)!

On the weekend of November 4th, 9 Hack Clubbers gathered to host a 1-day hackathon for 39 Girl Scouts who, by the end of the event, created their first coding project! ðŸ’»
