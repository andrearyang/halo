Sprig Fiasco: How to deal with the unexpected
It does help to have the founder of hack club there to figure things out with the HQ engineers
Step 1: don't panic, and blame it all on the sprig editor bcuz its something none of us have control over (even though Nila was 100% blocking the wifi with her amazing presence)
Step 2: make sure to copy paste the code somewhere else as soon as you can, even a google doc or emailing it to yourself works!
Step 3: distract with a fun break, like beadmaking
Step 4: celebrate and laugh about it bcuz you handled it really well (high five to you!)
