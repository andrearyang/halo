Sprig Fiasco: How to deal with the unexpected

The sprig servers were down because we made too many games (a great problem to have!). This happened around the middle of the hackathon so many people had finished a good chunk of their coding. We were getting false errors, difficulty running code, and most importantly the code was no longer saving. We're really proud of the hacker mindset we saw--they kept trying, rewriting code, and working around the issues.

Now that you have the background, here's how we handled it:
Step 1: don't panic, it will scare the coders and the goal is to have a welcoming, fun environment to learn in

Step 2: make sure to copy paste the code somewhere else as soon as you can, even a google doc or emailing it to yourself works!

Step 3: distract with a fun break, like beadmaking (it can take some of the frustration and stress out that comes with running into issues)

Step 4: celebrate and laugh about it because you handled it really well (high five to you!)
