Sprig Fiasco: How to deal with the unexpected

The sprig servers were down because we made too many games (a great problem to have!). This happened around the middle of the hackathon so many people had finished a good chunk of their coding. We were getting false errors, difficulty running code, and most importantly the code was no longer saving. We're really proud of the hacker mindset we saw--they kept trying, rewriting code, and working around the issues.

Now that you have the background, here's how we handled it:
1: We noticed the issue crop up in a few of the games at first. We offerred possible explanations (a lot of amazing code that's taking time to run, slow wifi etc) and helped resolve the issues where we could.

2: When people went to save their games, it was very slow and didn't work. We everyone copy paste the code somewhere else as soon as we could, even a google doc or emailing it to yourself works!

3: Hackathon organizers used Distraction. Dun-dun-dun It was pretty effective, targets successfully occupied with beadmaking. Having a fun activity on hand helped take some of the frustration and stress out that comes with running into issues.

(big thank you to Zach and HQ engineers for helping get Sprig up and running again!! â™¡)

4: Arguably the most important step is to have fun because the goal is to create a fun, welcoming environment to learn coding even if we run into the unexpected!
